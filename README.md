# KIC 8462852 (Tabby's Star)
KIC 8462852 A is a variable star featuring irregular light fluctuations, including a dimming of 22% in brightness. The cause is not fully understood, with several hypotheses ranging from an uneven ring of dust orbiting the star to an artificial megastructure orbiting the star. Recent research has also demonstrated that Tabbyâ€™s star is extremely likely to be a binary star system.
